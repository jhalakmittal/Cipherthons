        <p>Our Online shopping portal “Fresh yields” will serve as a helping hand for both the farmers and their buyers. 
          Our responsive mobile friendly website will ensure that both farmers and the buyers get their requirements fulfilled after using our website.
          The website will have a complete list of all the farmers who are eager to sell their crops with the whole description like the prices, quality of the crops, their specifications, the particular variety they are selling, etc.
          The buyer can simply login on the page and can view the complete list of any crop he is interested in, and can compare the quality, price, etc. with all the other farmers who are selling the crop around different regions and hence, the buyer can have a full idea about the rates of that particular crop.
          Our website will provide the additional features of slot booking, i.e. buyer can choose a convenient time where he wish to get his crops delivered or the time when he wishes to pick the crop directly from the farmers and farmer will be ready with his order.
          The website will be multilingual so as to ease out the usage among the users and the farmers and will be optimised extensively so as to reduce the loading time.
          Additional features for farmers will also be there, like they will be getting the details of the nearby mandis or the wholesale markets where they can sell their crops, list of crop pricing around the different places will also be available so that the farmers can compare the prices and sell accordingly.
          This website will use sms as a means of communication between the buyers and the farmers so as to ease out any internet issues.
